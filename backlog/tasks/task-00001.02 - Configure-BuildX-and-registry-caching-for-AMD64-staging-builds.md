## Description

Update the GitHub Actions workflow to add BuildX setup and configure registry-based caching for the AMD64 build job to leverage Docker layer caching across builds

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 step is added after checkout in AMD64 job,Registry cache configuration is added to build-push-action with cache-from and cache-to parameters,Cache tags use buildcache-amd64 naming convention for architecture-specific caching,Build job runs successfully with caching enabled,No impact on existing build outputs or functionality
<!-- AC:END -->
