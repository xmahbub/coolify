## Description

Test the complete Docker build caching implementation by running multiple staging builds and measuring performance improvements to ensure the 40% build time reduction target is achieved

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 First build after cache implementation runs successfully (expected slower due to cache population),Second and subsequent builds show significant time reduction compared to baseline,Build time reduction of at least 40% is achieved and documented,GitHub Actions minutes consumption is reduced compared to baseline measurements,All Docker images function identically to pre-optimization builds,No build failures or regressions are introduced by caching changes
<!-- AC:END -->
