## Description

Measure and document current staging build times for both AMD64 and AARCH64 architectures before implementing caching optimizations to establish a performance baseline for comparison

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Baseline build times are measured for at least 3 consecutive AMD64 builds,Baseline build times are measured for at least 3 consecutive AARCH64 builds,Average build time and GitHub Actions minutes consumption are documented,Baseline measurements include both cold builds and any existing warm builds,Results are documented in a format suitable for comparing against post-optimization builds
<!-- AC:END -->
